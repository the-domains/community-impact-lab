## **We're changing the way families live, work, and give!**

We have a mission to engage families, empower parents, and envision solutions to challenges in our communities in our Family Support, Learning, and Social Good LABs. 

Families come together to connect, share skills, and create change through innovative project-based initiatives. We aim to remove obstacles that often prevent families from fully engaging in their communities by providing tools and resources, focusing on building agency, and enabling parents to participate _with_ their kids. 

Each initiative is designed for families and focus on achieving outcomes that help address social, educational, or economic challenges that parents, and especially mothers, face. The result? Parents are better able to live, give, and work to their fullest potential, and communities thrive.
